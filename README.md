# Topic 04 - team 04: The role of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs) in the embryonic development
====================================================================================

**Participants:**
* Nina Droste, Aleksandra Dohren, Amena ElMaadawy, Mariam Hassan

**Supervisors:**
* Dr. Maria Dinkelacker, Ian Fichtner* 

**Introduction:**

We used mouse data of dataset [GSE18290](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE18290). The chips contained data from six different cell stages, ranging from 1cell stage to blastocyst cell stage, in three replicates. 
Our aim was to compare mouse TRA-gene tables, provided by Dr. Maria Dinkelacker, with TRAs present in our dataset.

We were interested in finding out, if:\\

\\

Additionally, we focussed on three sub question, that could be answered during our project. 
> Is the greatest TRA expression found between the fourth and eighth cell stage?
> Is TRA expression in bovine comparable to TRA expression in mouse?
> Which is the earliest biological function expressed by those genes?
