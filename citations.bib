  title     = "The role of hypoxia in development of the Mammalian embryo",
  author    = "Dunwoodie, Sally L",
  abstract  = "Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor that
               acts in low-oxygen conditions. The cellular response to HIF
               activation is transcriptional upregulation of a large group of
               genes. Some target genes promote anaerobic metabolism to reduce
               oxygen consumption, while others ``alleviate'' hypoxia by acting
               non-cell-autonomously to extend and modify the surrounding
               vasculature. Although hypoxia is often thought of as being a
               pathological phenomenon, the mammalian embryo in fact develops
               in a low-oxygen environment, and in this context HIF has
               additional responsibilities. This review describes how low
               oxygen and HIF affect gene expression, cell behavior, and
               ultimately morphogenesis of the embryo and placenta.",

@ARTICLE{Patterson2010,
  title     = "Hypoxia and fetal heart development",
  author    = "Patterson, A J and Zhang, L",
  abstract  = "Fetal hearts show a remarkable ability to develop under hypoxic
               conditions. The metabolic flexibility of fetal hearts allows
               sustained development under low oxygen conditions. In fact,
               hypoxia is critical for proper myocardial formation.
               Particularly, hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and vascular
               endothelial growth factor play central roles in
               hypoxia-dependent signaling in fetal heart formation, impacting
               embryonic outflow track remodeling and coronary vessel growth.
               Although HIF is not the only gene involved in adaptation to
               hypoxia, its role places it as a central figure in orchestrating
               events needed for adaptation to hypoxic stress. Although
               ``normal'' hypoxia (lower oxygen tension in the fetus as
               compared with the adult) is essential in heart formation,
               further abnormal hypoxia in utero adversely affects
               cardiogenesis. Prenatal hypoxia alters myocardial structure and
               causes a decline in cardiac performance. Not only are the
               effects of hypoxia apparent during the perinatal period, but
               prolonged hypoxia in utero also causes fetal programming of
               abnormality in the heart's development. The altered expression
               pattern of cardioprotective genes such as protein kinase c
               epsilon, heat shock protein 70, and endothelial nitric oxide
               synthase, likely predispose the developing heart to increased
               vulnerability to ischemia and reperfusion injury later in life.
               The events underlying the long-term changes in gene expression
               are not clear, but likely involve variation in epigenetic
               regulation.",

               mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase that regulates the activity of
               both oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and cell death. Here, we
               have developed transgenic Tet-On and Tet-Off mice that express a
               mutant active form of hIF1 in the hepatocytes to restrain OXPHOS
               in the liver to investigate the relevance of mitochondrial
               activity in hepatocarcinogenesis. The expression of hIF1
               promotes the inhibition of OXPHOS in both Tet-On and Tet-Off
               mouse models and induces a state of metabolic preconditioning
               guided by the activation of the stress kinases AMPK and p38
               MAPK. Expression of the transgene significantly augmented
               proliferation and apoptotic resistance of carcinoma cells, which
               contributed to an enhanced diethylnitrosamine-induced liver
               carcinogenesis. Moreover, the expression of hIF1 also diminished
               acetaminophen-induced apoptosis, which is unrelated to
               differences in permeability transition pore opening.
               Mechanistically, cell survival in hIF1-preconditioned
               hepatocytes results from a nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related
               factor (Nrf2)-guided antioxidant response. The results emphasize

  abstract  = "The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important for
               embryonic development and the formation of various tissues or
               organs. However, EMT dysfunction in normal cells leads to
               diseases, such as cancer or fibrosis. During the EMT, epithelial
               cells are converted into more invasive and active mesenchymal
               cells. E-box-binding proteins, including Snail, ZEB and
               helix-loop-helix family members, serve as EMT-activating
               transcription factors. These transcription factors repress the
               expression of epithelial markers, for example, E-cadherin,
               rearrange the cytoskeleton and promote the expression of
               mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin, fibronectin and other
               EMT-activating transcription factors. Signaling pathways that
               induce EMT, including transforming growth factor-$\beta$,
               Wnt/glycogen synthase kinase-3$\beta$, Notch and receptor
               tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, interact with each other for
               the regulation of this process. Although the mechanism(s)
               underlying EMT in cancer or embryonic development have been
               identified, the mechanism(s) in embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
               remain unclear. In this review, we describe the underlying
               mechanisms of important EMT factors, indicating a precise role
               for EMT in ESCs, and characterize the relationship between EMT
               and ESCs.",

  title     = "Epigenetic control of cell fate in mouse blastocysts: the role
               of covalent histone modifications and chromatin remodeling",
  author    = "Paul, Soumen and Knott, Jason G",
  abstract  = "The first cell-fate decision in mammalian preimplantation
               embryos is the segregation of the inner cell mass (ICM) and
               trophectoderm (TE) cell lineages. The ICM develops into the
               embryo proper, whereas the TE ensures embryo implantation and is
               the source of the extra-embryonic trophoblast cell lineages,
               which contribute to the functional components of the placenta.
               The development of a totipotent zygote into a multi-lineage
               blastocyst is associated with the generation of distinct
               transcriptional programs. Several key transcription factors
               participate in the ICM and TE-specific transcriptional networks,
               and recent studies indicate that post-translational histone
               modifications as well as ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling
               complexes converge with these transcriptional networks to
               regulate ICM and TE lineage specification. This review will
               discuss our current understanding and future perspectives
               related to transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms
               that are implicated in the initial mammalian lineage commitment
